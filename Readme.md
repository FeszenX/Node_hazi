This project is my homework for "Server side JavaScript".

To try it out, you will need to install Node.js and MongoDB.

First, you will need to download the npm dependencies.
    From the root directory of the project, in command prompt run the following command:
    npm install

Then start the MongoDB server to serve the application.

After these steps, you can run the following command in command prompt from the root directory of the project to start the application:
    npm start

You will get the port number in the console.

In a browser, you can reach the application at "localhost:[portnumber]" URL.
